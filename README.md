A Machine Learning Model: Bearing faults classification and prediction from vibration data for Induction Motor

In industrial settings, the reliable operation of motor equipment is paramount to maintaining
continuous operations and ensuring safety. Motors are essential components in
various machinery and systems, and their vibrations can serve as valuable indicators of
their operational health. These vibrations encompass a spectrum of conditions, ranging
from normal operational states to potentially critical faults or anomalies.
Accurately detecting and classifying these vibration patterns is crucial for implementing
effective predictive maintenance strategies. Machine learning models, particularly those
designed for anomaly detection using motor vibration data, play a pivotal role in this
process. By analysing the complex patterns within vibration data, these models can
identify deviations from normal operating conditions that may signify impending issues
such as bearing wear, misalignment, or structural defects.
In essence, the development and deployment of machine learning models for anomaly detection
in motor vibration data not only enhance predictive maintenance capabilities but
also contribute significantly to overall operational efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness
in industrial environments. By harnessing the power of data analytics, industries can
move towards more proactive and sustainable maintenance practices, ensuring the reliability
and longevity of critical motor equipment.
